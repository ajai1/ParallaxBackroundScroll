        <h2>Understand Your Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            If I ask you, "What do you want out of life?" and you say something like, 
            "I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like", your response is so common and expected
            that it doesn't really mean anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everybody enjoys what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy, and easy life to fall in love
            and have amazing relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired.
            Everybody wants that.
        </p>
        <p>
            A more interesting question, a question that most people never consider, is,
            "What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?" Because that seems to be
            a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.

        <h2>Responsibilites</h2>
        <p>
            We all love to take responsibility for success and happiness.
            Hell, we often fight over who gets to be responsible for success and happiness.
            But taking responsibility for our problems is far more important, because that's where the
            real learning comes from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsibilites is where the real-life improvement comes from. To simply blame others is only to 
            hurt yourself.

        <h2>Choose It Well</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine that somebody puts a gun to your head and tells you that you have to run 26.2 miles in under
            five hours, or else he'll kill you and your entire family. That would suck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now imagine that you bought nice shoes and running gear, trained religiously for months, and completed your
            first marathon with all of your closest family and friends cheering you on at the finish line.
        </p>
        <p>
            That could potentially be one of the proudest moments of your life. Exact same 26.2 miles. Exact same person
            running them. Exact same pain coursing through your exact same legs. But when you chose it freely 
            and prepared for it, it was a glorious and important milestone in your life.
